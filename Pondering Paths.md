# Pondering Paths

## The Root
Directory- It contains other files or directories. We refer to the directories by their respective paths. If two directories have the same path then it indicatesthat they are under the same directory. Paths are similar to the roots of a tree.
I just put in the commands "/pwn" which is path of the flag which gave me access to the flag.

## Program and absolute paths
I first tried doing /challenge followed by /run to get to the flag just like we access files using their path in the linux terminal. Don't know why that didn't work. Put in the command in a single line to get the flag.

## Position thy self
I learnt that we can move through directories using the cd command. I ran /challenge/run command to get the path of the directory in which the flag is hidden. I then used cd command to change directories to the given directory and then typed the initial sub-part to get the flag.
